\begin{document}
On a two-dimensional plane (\(x,y\)), two initial points lie on the same continuous line, vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.\\
You are given a series of two \(x,y\) points, each two points forming a new line on the same plane. For every newly-formed line, find out if it intersects with the original line.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Input Format}

\vspace{5mm}

The first and second lines contain two space-separated integers denoting the values for the two initial \(x,y\) points, marking the original line.\\
The third line contains one integer, \(T\), the number of test cases.\\
Each test case consists of two lines, every line being a new \(x,y\) point, marking the new line.

\textbf{Constraints}

\vspace{5mm}

\(1 ≤ T ≤ 10\)\\
\(-10^4 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 10^4\)\\

\textbf{Output Format}

\vspace{5mm}

For every test case, print out NO if the newly-formed line does not intersect with the original line.\\
Print out YES if the newly-formed line does.

\textbf{Explanation}

\vspace{5mm}

Initial points, (0,4) and (0,-4), form a vertical line along the \(y\)-axis.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the first test case, the two given points, (1,3) and (1,-3), form a vertical line along \(x\) = 1. Since the initial line is also a vertical line, they do not cross.
  \item In the second test case, the two given points, (4,2) and (-4,-2), form a diagonal line across quadrant III and quadrant I of the \(x,y\) plane. The new line traverses through the point of origin (0,0), thus crossing through the original line as well.
\end{enumerate}
